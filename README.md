## 📌 Important Notes

> **This section is updated regularly. Check back often for the latest tips and announcements.**

| Date | Note |
|------|------|
| 2026-02-11 | **Start with 1 parallel agent.** We recommend setting the parallel agent count to **1** for your first scans. Multi-agent mode (5x, 10x) is powerful but consumes significantly more LLM tokens and may overwhelm smaller targets. Scale up gradually once you're comfortable with the results. |
| 2026-02-11 | **Use DeepSeek V3 for cost-effective testing.** If you're exploring PenPard for the first time, DeepSeek V3 offers excellent results at a fraction of the cost (~$0.02-0.10 per scan). Switch to GPT-4.1 or Claude 4 Sonnet for production assessments. |
| 2026-02-11 | **Always whitelist your target first.** PenPard requires targets to be whitelisted in the Admin Panel before scanning. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental testing of unauthorized targets. |
| 2026-02-11 | **Burp Suite must be running before you start a scan.** The PenPard MCP Connect extension needs to be loaded and active. Check the status bar at the bottom of the app — Burp status should show "online". |
| 2026-02-11 | **Scan instructions make a big difference.** Use the "Scan Instructions" field to guide the AI. For example: *"Focus on the /api/v2 endpoints"* or *"Test the login form for SQL injection"*. Specific instructions produce better, faster results. |
| 2026-02-11 | **Focused scans are enforced at code level.** When you write instructions like *"only test /login for SQL injection"*, PenPard's Instruction-Aware Scope Engine analyzes your prompt with the LLM, extracts exact endpoints and vuln types, and **blocks enumeration tools** (spider, sitemap) at the code level. The AI literally cannot go out of scope. |

## What is PenPard?

PenPard is an **open-source, AI-driven penetration testing application** that uses Large Language Models to autonomously plan, execute, and report security assessments. It integrates directly with **Burp Suite Professional** through a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) extension, giving AI agents full control over HTTP requests, scanning, and traffic analysis.

Think of it as an **AI pentester** that works alongside you — it can scan autonomously, or pause and assist you during manual testing.

**PenPard is completely free to use** — no subscriptions, no usage limits, no premium tiers. You only pay for the LLM API calls you make (or use Ollama for $0). **Your data never leaves your machine.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/dashboard.png" alt="PenPard Dashboard — Control Center with scan stats, recent scans, and quick actions" width="800" />
  <br/>
  <em>The Dashboard — your home base. Launch web or mobile scans, track total scans, vulnerabilities found, reports generated, and token usage at a glance. Recent scans are listed with their status. The bottom bar shows live connection status for LLM, Burp Suite, MobSF, and MCP servers.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">

  <br/>
  <em>Enter a target URL, write scan instructions in plain English, configure rate limits and parallel agents — then hit Scan.</em>
</p>

### 🖥️ Run Anywhere — Web or Desktop

PenPard is not locked to a single platform. Use it however you prefer:

| Mode | How | Best For |
|------|-----|----------|
| **🌐 Web App** | `npm run dev` or Docker → open `http://localhost:3000` in any browser | Quick setup, no install needed, remote access |
| **🖥️ Desktop App** | Download the installer or build with `npm run pack:win / pack:mac / pack:linux` | Native experience, system tray, auto-updates |

Both modes offer the **exact same features** — the same dashboard, same AI agents, same Burp Suite integration. The desktop app is just the web app wrapped in Electron with native OS integration.

| Platform | Web App | Desktop App |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Any browser | ✅ `.exe` installer |
| **macOS** | ✅ Any browser | ✅ `.dmg` installer |
| **Linux** | ✅ Any browser | ✅ `.AppImage` / `.deb` |
| **Docker** | ✅ `docker-compose up` | — |

> **TL;DR:** If you just want to try PenPard, run `npm run dev` and open your browser. If you want a polished desktop experience with auto-updates, grab the installer for your OS.

## The Problem with Current AI Security Tools

AI is transforming cybersecurity, but today's tools come with serious trade-offs:

#### 1. Commercial AI Pentest Platforms Are Prohibitively Expensive

| Tool | Pricing | Model |
|------|---------|-------|
| Tool 1 | $100,000+ / year | SaaS, closed source |
| Tool 2 | Enterprise pricing (custom quote) | Cloud-only |
| Tool 3 | $50,000+ / year | SaaS |
| Tool 4 | $5,000+ / year per user | Licensed |

Most teams — especially startups, independent researchers, and smaller security firms — simply can't afford these. PenPard costs **$0** and gives you full access to the source code.

#### 2. "AI Pentest" Often Means "ChatGPT Wrapper"

Many tools market themselves as AI-powered but are just thin wrappers around GPT:

- **They can't actually test anything.** They generate suggestions, not real HTTP requests. You still do all the work.
- **No tool integration.** They don't connect to Burp Suite, don't have access to proxy traffic, and can't interact with the target application.
- **Hallucinated vulnerabilities.** Without actual verification, LLMs confidently report vulnerabilities that don't exist. Studies show GPT-4 produces false positives in **60-80%** of security assessments when used without execution capabilities.

PenPard's agents don't just *think* about attacks — they **execute them** through Burp Suite, analyze real responses, and validate findings with a dedicated Recheck Agent.

#### 3. SaaS Tools Mean Your Data Leaves Your Network

Cloud-based security platforms require you to expose your target application or send scan data to external servers. For enterprises, regulated industries, or bug bounty hunters working under NDA, this is a dealbreaker.

**PenPard runs 100% locally.** Your targets, findings, LLM prompts, and reports never leave your machine.

#### 4. Black-Box AI Gives You No Visibility

Most AI security tools operate as a black box: you press "Scan" and get a report. You have no idea what the AI tested, what it missed, or why it made certain decisions.

PenPard gives you **full transparency**:
- Watch every agent decision in real-time logs
- Read the exact prompts sent to the LLM
- Interact with the agent mid-scan via chat
- Pause the scan, test manually, and let the AI assist you
- Customize system prompts and testing strategies

### Why PenPard?

| | Traditional Scanners | ChatGPT / AI Wrappers | Commercial AI Platforms | **PenPard** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $500-5,000/yr | API costs only | $50,000-200,000/yr | **Free & open source** |
| **Actually executes attacks** | Yes (rule-based) | No (suggestions only) | Yes | **Yes (via Burp Suite)** |
| **AI reasoning** | No | Yes (but no execution) | Yes | **Yes** |
| **False positive reduction** | Moderate | Very poor | Good | **Recheck Agent validates every finding** |
| **Your data stays local** | Sometimes | No (cloud API) | No (SaaS) | **Always — 100% local** |
| **Transparency** | Limited | None | None | **Full logs, prompts, decisions visible** |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | No | Manual | Limited | **Pause & Assist workflow** |
| **Custom LLM provider** | N/A | Locked to vendor | Locked to vendor | **6 providers + any Ollama model** |
| **Source code access** | No | No | No | **GPL-3.0** |
| **Context-aware payloads** | No (fixed lists) | Yes (but untested) | Partially | **Yes — generated and tested** |
| **Web + Desktop** | Desktop only | Web only | SaaS only | **Both — browser or native app** |

### How PenPard Reduces False Positives

One of the biggest problems in AI-assisted security testing is **hallucination** — the LLM confidently reports a vulnerability that doesn't actually exist. PenPard addresses this at multiple levels:

```
1. EXECUTION, NOT SPECULATION
   └─ Agents send real HTTP requests through Burp → analyze actual responses
      (not "this endpoint might be vulnerable based on the URL pattern")

2. RECHECK AGENT
   └─ Every suspected finding is re-tested with additional payloads
   └─ LLM analyzes both the original and recheck responses
   └─ Only confirmed findings are reported

3. EVIDENCE-BASED REPORTING
   └─ Each vulnerability includes the exact request/response pair
   └─ CVSS 4.0 scoring based on actual impact, not guesswork

4. HUMAN OVERSIGHT
   └─ You see every decision in real-time
   └─ You can intervene, correct, or redirect the AI at any time
```

### Cost Comparison: PenPard vs. Alternatives

Running PenPard with different LLM providers (estimated cost per scan):

| LLM Provider | Cost per Scan (avg) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ollama (local)** | **$0.00** | Run Llama 3, Mistral, etc. on your own hardware |
| **DeepSeek V3** | ~$0.02-0.10 | Extremely cost-effective cloud option |
| **GPT-4.1 mini** | ~$0.05-0.20 | Good balance of cost and performance |
| **GPT-4.1** | ~$0.30-1.50 | Strong general performance |
| **Claude 4 Sonnet** | ~$0.50-2.00 | Excellent reasoning |
| **GPT-5.1** | ~$1.00-5.00 | Maximum capability |

With token usage tracking built in, you always know exactly what you're spending. Compare this to $50,000+/year for commercial alternatives.

## ✨ Features

### AI-Powered Scanning
- **Orchestrator Agent** — LLM-driven scan lifecycle: reconnaissance, planning, testing, reporting
- **Agent Pool** — Parallel scanning with specialized workers (crawler, scanner, fuzzer, analyzer)
- **Recheck Agent** — Validates findings with additional payloads to reduce false positives
- **Smart Assist** — Detects your manual testing patterns and offers to help automatically
- **Instruction-Aware Scope Engine** — See below

### Instruction-Aware Scope Engine

When you provide scan instructions (e.g., *"only focus on /login and test for SQL injection"*), PenPard doesn't just pass your text to the AI and hope for the best. Before the scan begins, your instructions are analyzed by the LLM to produce a structured scope definition:

```
Your instruction: "only focus on /login endpoint, test for SQL injection only, then finish"

                        │  ✓ generate_payloads → OK    │
                        └──────────────────────────────┘
```

This means:
- **Focused scans skip all reconnaissance** — no spidering, no sitemap, no directory brute-force
- **Enumeration tools are blocked at the code level** — even if the AI tries to call them, the system refuses
- **Every planning round is scope-locked** — the AI is reminded of your instructions in every prompt
- **Auto-finish** — when the specified scope is thoroughly tested, the scan completes automatically

For full-site scans (no specific instructions), the agent follows the standard multi-phase methodology: discovery → mapping → testing → deep exploitation.

### Burp Suite Integration
- **PenPard MCP Connect** — Custom Burp extension providing 20+ tools via Model Context Protocol
- Full proxy history access, site map, scanner, repeater, intruder integration
- AI agents craft and send HTTP requests through Burp's proxy engine

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- **Burp Suite Professional** with the PenPard MCP Connect extension loaded
- An **LLM API key** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or a local Ollama instance)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/penpard/penpard.git
cd penpard

# Install all dependencies (root + frontend + backend)
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and settings
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start backend + frontend concurrently
npm run dev

# Or start with Electron
npm run dev:electron
```

### Docker Deployment

Run PenPard with Docker Compose — no Node.js installation required on the host:

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/penpard/penpard.git
cd penpard
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your JWT_SECRET and other settings

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend:  http://localhost:4000
```

> **Note:** Burp Suite runs on your host machine (not inside Docker). The backend reaches Burp via `host.docker.internal:9876`. Make sure the PenPard MCP Connect extension is loaded in Burp before starting a scan.

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Data is persisted in `./backend/data/` on your host, so your database and scan results survive container restarts.

### Production Build (Desktop App)

```bash
# Windows
npm run pack:win

# macOS
npm run pack:mac

# Linux
npm run pack:linux
```

### Burp Extension Setup

1. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   cd burp-extension
   ./gradlew build
   ```
2. In Burp Suite → Extensions → Add → Select the built JAR file
3. The MCP server starts automatically on port `9876`
4. Configure the port and settings in the "PenPard" tab in Burp

### Lock Screen

PenPard uses a lock screen to protect access. There are no traditional username/password credentials.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Autonomous Scan Flow

```
1. User configures target URL and scan options
2. OrchestratorAgent initializes with LLM context
3. PLANNING phase — LLM analyzes target, creates attack plan
4. RECONNAISSANCE — Crawls site via Burp, discovers endpoints
5. TESTING — Iterates over endpoints:
   ├── Generates context-aware payloads (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
   ├── Sends requests through Burp MCP
   ├── Analyzes responses with LLM
   ├── RecheckAgent validates suspected findings
   └── Saves confirmed vulnerabilities
6. REPORTING — Generates PDF report with CVSS 4.0 scores
```

Here's what this looks like in practice — the Agent Logs panel shows every decision the AI makes in real time:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/agent-logs.png" alt="PenPard Agent Logs — AI planning and executing attacks in real time" width="380" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="docs/screenshots/sqli-finding.png" alt="PenPard SQL Injection Finding — Confirmed HIGH severity vulnerability with AI analysis" width="500" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Left: Agent Logs — The AI plans its attack steps, then executes them one by one. Here it's testing authentication endpoints for SQLi, sending payloads through Burp, and analyzing responses.<br/>
  Right: A confirmed SQL Injection finding (HIGH, CVSS 8.0). The AI sent <code>' OR '1'='1</code> to the login endpoint, got a valid JWT back, and flagged it as an authentication bypass. You can chat with the AI Security Analyst to understand the vulnerability deeper — here it explains in Turkish why <code>1=1</code> works.</em>
</p>

### Pause & Assist Flow

```
1. User pauses the scan → Agent loop suspends (stays alive)
2. Activity Monitor auto-starts → Watches Burp proxy history
3. User tests manually in Burp (e.g., tries SQLi payloads)
4. Monitor detects the pattern → Shows "SQL Injection Testing Detected" alert
5. User clicks "Assist" → Focused scan on that endpoint
6. User clicks "Resume" → Main scan continues from where it left off
```

### Mission Control

The real-time scan dashboard shows:
- **Live agent logs** — Every decision the AI makes
- **Vulnerability findings** — Discovered in real-time with severity badges
- **Interactive chat** — Send commands to the agent mid-scan
- **Pause/Resume controls** — Take over when you want to
- **Progress tracking** — Phase-by-phase scan progress

## 🔧 Burp Extension — PenPard MCP Connect

The custom Burp Suite extension exposes 20+ tools via the Model Context Protocol:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **HTTP** | `send_http_request`, `get_proxy_history`, `get_sitemap` |
| **Scanning** | `send_to_scanner`, `get_scanner_issues`, `spider_url` |
| **Testing** | `send_to_repeater`, `send_to_intruder`, `check_authorization` |
| **Scope** | `add_to_scope`, `get_scope` |
| **Encoding** | `url_encode`, `url_decode`, `base64_encode`, `base64_decode`, `hash_data` |
| **Analysis** | `extract_links`, `extract_comments`, `generate_payloads` |
| **Control** | `enable_intercept`, `disable_intercept`, `get_burp_version` |
| **Monitor** | `get_user_activity` |

### Building the Extension

```bash
cd burp-extension
./gradlew build
# Output: build/libs/penpard-mcp-connect-*.jar
```

## 📊 Token Usage Tracking

PenPard tracks every LLM API call locally:

- **Per-call logging** — Provider, model, input/output tokens, context
- **Dashboard widget** — Total tokens used at a glance
- **Detailed analytics page** — Filter by month, group by model
- **Daily breakdown chart** — Input vs output token distribution
- **All data stays local** — Stored in SQLite, never sent externally

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/token-usage-overview.png" alt="PenPard Token Usage — Usage by model and daily breakdown chart" width="420" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="docs/screenshots/token-usage-detail.png" alt="PenPard Token Usage — Detailed per-call log with input/output token counts" width="420" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Left: Overview — total calls, token counts, usage by model, and a daily input vs output chart. Know exactly what you're spending.<br/>
  Right: Detailed Log — every single LLM call with timestamp, provider, model, input/output tokens, and total. Full transparency, zero surprises.</em>
</p>

## 🛡 Security

- **JWT authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
- **Role-based access control** (Super Admin, Admin, User)
- **Auth guards** on all sensitive routes
- **CORS protection** with strict origin whitelist
- **Helmet security headers**
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
- **All data stored locally** — SQLite database, no cloud dependencies
